### Anchor

Here, we use two anchors in our regex example which are: ^ which represents the behhining of either a string or a line and the $ which represents the end of said string and line.
### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are  known to be greedy since they want to match as many patterns as they possibly can. Thye work by setting the limit of your string to match the 

We have two examples of quantifiers which are: ? which works bt matching the pattern zero or one time. and the {n} which matches the n number of times.
